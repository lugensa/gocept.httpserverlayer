buildout configuration
======================

gocept.httpserverlayer integrates with quite a lot of different web frameworks,
so there are quite a lot of buildout configurations for this package, so we are
able to run our tests against all the different software versions we integrate
with. These configurations reside in the ``flavours/`` directory, and you can
employ one by editing ``buildout.cfg`` and extending it::

    [buildout]
    extends = flavours/MY_FLAVOUR.cfg
